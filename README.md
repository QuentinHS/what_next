So basically it will go like this:

If the user already knows their personality type, either keirsey or Myer-Briggs, they can put it in and it will generate
jobs that might suit their personality. ie, input 'intj' and it will list jobs in some format that suits that personality.

If they don't know their type, they can take the quiz to find out their personality type. They go through the entire 70 question quiz, get assigned a personality type, and then they get given a suggestion based on weighting of factors. 

Finally, they can directly compare two jobs. It will compare salary, growth etc between the jobs.
